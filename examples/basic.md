# Hello World

This is a basic example document.

```bash
echo "hello, world!"
```

```node
console.log("This is running a node implementation!")
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

Here is an example doing actual work:
```bash
kubectl get ns
```

You should also take a look at [basic2](basic2.md).

This is an example of what an outout with an error looks like:
```sh
echo "This is an error"
exit 1
```
